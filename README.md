# Crypto Clustering

The project is based on creating a prototype to submit our crypto portfolio proposal by including other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for our portfolio. Rather than basing our recommendation on only returns and volatility

## The steps followed in this project are :

* Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the Original Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the PCA Data
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Visualize and Compare the Results



## Installation:

To navigate through this project, you may need to install the following on your machine :
`Jupyter` - Running code
`Pandas` - Data analysis
`hvPlot` - Interactive Pandas plots

## Usage
First, make sure the following libraries are running properly:
* import pandas as pd
* import hvplot.pandas
* from pathlib import Path
* from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
* from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
* from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler*

Second, click on the play icon on the toolbar of the Jupyter lab to start
